This directory contains the files you will need for lab09
io.c
    This file handles most of the IO in the program, including sending 
    and recieving data, print recieved message and read input.
    It encapulate these IO, so we can provide consistent format for both
    server and client.

client.c
    This is the file containing client code. The client established 
    the connection with the server. Then the user needs to enter his name.
    Whenever it sends out the data user types, and prints out the message 
    recieved.

server.c
    This is the file containing server code. The server tracks the socket, 
    name for each client. It creates a thread for each client connect.
    Whenever it takes some message, either from its own input or recieved 
    data, it broadcast the message to every connected client. Essentially, 
    this is a multi-person chat room.
